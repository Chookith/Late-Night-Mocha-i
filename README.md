# Late Night Coffee i

## Update notes 1.6.0

- OK

- there has been a major restructure of this theme

  - It has come to my attention that none of the colors were in sync across the languages. So I've fixed that

  - There were a few messy mistakes (forgetting to add comments to the theme) this restructuring aims to fix that

- Reactjsx and Tsx are different languages so I've fixed that

  - I honestly thought they were the same. :(

- Ruby has been added to the languages

## I've finished on the light version

Morning Coffee i is here!... finally

## i look like this
